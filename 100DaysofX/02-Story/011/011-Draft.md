    CWS-010 | Device ~ Dialogue

Only one of my stories thus far has really had any [dialogue](https://literarydevices.net/dialogue/). I guess I hadn't really thought deeply about how to use it effectively. Only now that I sit down to write some dialogue do I realize how difficult it can be.

One way I was thinking of getting warmed up is to sketch out some of the scenes where Alia enters into dialogue with those who help implement her plan. One of the difficult things for me is to imagine difficult conversations; conflict. I need to break it down and just focus on one part at a time.

Here's [an article](https://www.standoutbooks.com/6-insanely-good-dialogue-tips-from-your-future-literary-agent/) that seems to have some good advice for writing dialogue.

1. No explanation necessary
   1. Focus on what the character is saying, not how they are saying it
   2. Dialogue that requires explanation is probably badly written.
2. Don't use "-ly" adverbs
   1. A powerful dialogue conveys through what's being said rather than how it is being said
3. Keep your dialogue transparent
   1. "Said" should be the go-to verb when writing dialogue
4. Become a student of conversation
   1. Listen to people talking and note all the aspects of the conversation
      1. Gestures
      2. Expressions
      3. Tones
      4. Reactions
      5. Body language
   2. Body language can be used (sparingly; effectively) to break up the monotony of "said"
5. If it serves no purpose, it has to go
   1. Dialogue that doesn't move the plot or provide depth to a character or relevant subject, it should be removed
6. Read it aloud

[Another article on the same site](https://www.standoutbooks.com/your-dialogue-just-characters-talking/) has some good tidbits about the balance between writing "real" and clear dialogue. Expressionist dialogue is nothing like real speech, but is so tailored to express a deeper truth that it feels more genuine than real speech.

## Bewilder

Bewilder: to be suitable to.

This was the most fun she'd had in decades.

    CWS-010 ~ That line is cheesy af but I'm leaving it in for now as a reminder until I can figure out a way for her to express her utter enjoyment through dialogue alone.

    CWS-010 ~ Their conversation needs to have a good mixture of deeply philosophical concepts and intelligently light-hearted banter. Machrobians / Khaonos; works of art; travels; technologies, particularly bodily amendments. They could share an opinion on the topic of slavery and this brings them to the topic of the rising Syn Domari conflict.

"I was curious about the...preferences, of one such as yourself." Alia said, sipping her drink. They had already been through quite a few rounds together, enjoying various mixtures of various psychoactive substances. They were on their second consecutive Stiff Namantine Blue. Alia had to admit that she was surprised and more than a little impressed that the Queen had mixed all of the drinks herself except for one round when Alia made them both one of the favorites among the underground Ophons.

"I wouldn't stay long in my position if I was a too-tightly-tied prude. I probably wouldn't have ever risen to any significant role in the family." The Queen said. The more Alia heard about this queen and her people, the more she liked. "Plus...there are levels to life's fulfillments that many would consider impossible to reach without the help of the right exogenous compounds."

The Queen patted the side of the container which had popped out at her touch soon after Alia had made her appearance. Once opened, the container could be seen to hold a veritable arsenal of bottles, canisters, and tubes, some of which oozed visible gases of one type or another when opened.

"Have you heard the rumors coming from Syndo?"

The question hung in the air for a few moments as Alia tried to once again get a read on the Queen.

"One tends to hear many rumors living in a place like this." Alia sipped her drink, giving herself a few more moments to think. ""

Alia's instincts from decades of experience pleasing high-class patrons—and matrons, for that matter—were very strongly against being the first one to take a political stance.

    CWS-010 ~ They both have to have an objective, and the conversation should have a subject as well. It is somewhat obvious to the reader what Alia's objective is, 

The Queen was difficult to read, which was to be expected given her position and background. Alia was not sure how far she would have to go to get her into a room and out of that stunning dress.

Alia was in her element—they both were—yet neither knew the true intentions of the other.

    CWS-010 ~ The real question is whether the queen is part of Syn Domari, Annelo, or neither. It might be interesting for her to be independent as of this conversation, but leaning toward the Domari side of things. She is a powerful business magnate, after all, and could potentially make good use of some slaves. It would also throw not only Alia for a loop, but most likely the reader as well.
