## Miscellanea

The jagged shape of Olonor was visible from many miles out; tens of miles when approached via the valley to the north. Returning from two weeks of exploration, the Rider had spent the morning following the vague beginnings of a path that meandered along the valley floor. He watched as the jagged outline of the great starship came into view, the distance and the heat of mid-day making it swim in his vision.

The man wore a wide-brimmed hat, his shaded face covered by dark goggles and breathing mask. His body was wrapped in a length of neutral grey rough-looking fabric that helped protect his oversensitive skin while  allowing the breeze through.

That was the idea, anyways. This morning provided no breeze to cool down the Rider or his ride. The Rider sat in a harness strapped to the back of a four-legged animal which plodded along dutifully. Even, tawny scales covered all visible parts of the animal. A line of scales surrounding the beast's neck were tilted outward, revealing an array of vents beneath. Large whisps of steam rose from the vents, leaving a thin line of rising white gas behind the Rider, outlining the clouds of dust kicked up by the animal.

The Rider considering the valley before him, the tinted thick diamond lenses of his goggles making the scene look desceptively cool. The far side of the valley was made up of yet another range of colossal rocky peaks. The line of snow-capped mountains were regular—surprisingly so, for anyone not used to the planet's geology. 

One particular spot interrupted the regularity of wall. To the Rider, it looked as if a stray bolt from some terriblely powerful weapon had struck the planet at a highly obtuse angle, burning an ugly hole directly through a number of the majestic mountains. Unbidden, his mind's eye constructed an image of the planet-busting energy beam as it rent a gaping hole through miles of solid rock and swept across the valley, leaving a permanent scar across the otherwise untouched landscape.

The Rider knew where these thoughts led; he'd been down this path before. His mind had no trouble accessing memories of such violence and destuction—worse, actually.

Even after all the time they'd spent wandering aimlessly through the Well after escaping the war, the white-hot memories still seared a painful burn across his consciousness every time they were recalled.

He shuddered, attempting to bring some other thought his conscious mind; some distraction. He shook his head, focusing on his destination. Without the breeze that usually swept cold alpine air through the valley, he was already hot enough.

He could clearly see details among the rough shapes now.

Olonor, once a great interstellar hauler, lay in the middle of the valley like a centerpiece, the scar of its landfall still plainly visible as a perfectly straight trench connecting it to the mountains beyond. The main husk of the ship lay partially buried in the valley floor, deep enough that the rest of it angled out of the ground at an almost forty-five degree angle.

A collection of shanties and other jerry-rigged buildings lay in the shade of the above-ground section of the hull. Without his goggles, the light reflecting from the hull, though not as brilliant as it was upon landfall, would've hidden the sketchy little village from view.

As a precaution, the survivors of Olonor's landfall had braced the ship in case it decided to complete its landfall or simply break in half lengthwise. The patchwork metallite columns ribbed the space between the world and the upper holds of the ship from which massive fins had once extended. Once again the Rider's imagination wandered, transforming the braces into the legs of a mountainous insect.  

The owner-captain of Olonor at the time of landfall had—very creatively—named the village Olonor. The survivors rarely used that name anymore, however. Ironically, as if to spite the fates that had led to the wreck, the denizens called it Rexville.

He had recently gave it the name Miscellanea, in honor of them and the other refugee ships who had scattered in all directions after the great Syndicates had pulled out the big guns—the _really_ big guns.

Luckily, the Rider's home system was near the border of the Well, the "Shore", as many called it. Although the chances of surviving a trip into—or through—the Well were miniscule, the chance was still greater than zero, as none of the warships would risk the transit. He doubted any of the ships that fled away from the Well survived.

He was getting closer.

The red-orange sun had begun the downward marathon toward the sharp peaks. The world rotated much slower than the Rider's homeworld had,

While his exploration undoubtedly took far longer than it would if the various landcraft aboard the ship functioned, the slow pace of his trusty Mahlljin gave him the time to fully appreciate the natural beauty of his new homeworld. He was glad, however, that some of the genebanks aboard Olonor had survived transit and, more importantly, landfall. Without the genetic material of the animal on which he now rode, he'd be doing all of his exploring on foot.
