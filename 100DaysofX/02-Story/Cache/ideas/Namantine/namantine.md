## Namantine

"As if we weren't already."

She brought the glass up to her face, allowing tendrils of the  Queen handed to her. "Unique individuals always have unique tastes."

"You flatter yourself."

They had already been through quite a few rounds together, enjoying various mixtures of various psychoactive substances. They were on their second consecutive Stiff Namantine Blue. Alia had to admit that she was surprised and more than a little impressed that the Queen had mixed all of the drinks herself except for one round when Alia made them both one of the favorites among the underground Ophons.

"I wouldn't stay long in my position if I was too-tightly-tied. I probably wouldn't have ever risen to a significant role in the family." The Queen said. The more Alia heard about this queen and her people, the more she liked. "Plus...there are levels to life's fulfillments that many would consider impossible to reach without the help of the right exogenous compounds."

The Queen patted the side of the container which had popped out at her touch soon after Alia had made her appearance. Once opened, the container could be seen to hold a veritable arsenal of bottles, canisters, and tubes, some of which oozed visible gases of one type or another when opened.

"Have you heard the rumors coming from Syndo?"

The question hung in the air for a few moments as Alia tried to once again get a read on the Queen.

"One tends to hear many rumors living in a place like this." Alia sipped her drink, giving herself a few more moments to think. ""

Alia's instincts from decades of experience pleasing high-class patrons—and matrons, for that matter—were very strongly against being the first one to take a political stance.

    CWS-*** ~ They both have to have an objective, and the conversation should have a subject as well. It is somewhat obvious to the reader what Alia's objective is, 

The Queen was difficult to read, which was to be expected given her position and background. Alia was not sure how far she would have to go to get her into a room and out of that stunning dress.

Alia was in her element—they both were—yet neither knew the true intentions of the other.

    CWS-*** ~ The real question is whether the queen is part of Syn Domari, Annelo, or neither. It might be interesting for her to be independent as of this conversation, but leaning toward the Domari side of things. She is a powerful business magnate, after all, and could potentially make good use of some slaves. It would also throw not only Alia for a loop, but most likely the reader as well.
