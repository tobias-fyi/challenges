# 100 Days of Story

## Challenge 2/3 for 2019

For each story, there will be two markdown files: one is the first draft exactly how I left it at the end of the hour, with _all_ my notes and such; the other is the final formatted version.

### Be forewarned that if you read the `Draft` version first, you will run into spoilers.

I'm leaving the `Draft` version in both to make writing more of a "process" for me as well as in case anyone reading would find my writing notes interesting.
