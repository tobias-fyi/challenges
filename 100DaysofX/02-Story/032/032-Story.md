## Island

"A weird feeling has been with me ever since we touched down on the island. Before we began our descent, I was happy and without a care—more than that, really."

They had been walking, now they sat on the sand. The last of the light from the sun was giving the sky a griseous gradient that went from blue-grey near one horizon to black near the opposite.

"When did the transition happen?" The other one asked, "or—I guess a better one to start—do you...hmm...can you trace the feeling back to any specific moment?" He brought a handful of the coarse grains of sand up to eye level and watched as they cascaded through the cracks between his fingers. He could no longer see individual grains with the fading light, only a strong hint that something was there.

"I think I know what started it, though it doesn't make complete sense to me that something as trivial as forgetting a small, non-essential item at home—I left it behind; forgot to pack it—would be the cause. That's why I began to wonder if there's a deeper issue at play here and the realization of my mistake triggered it." He gazed distantly at the utterly flat line of the horizon. There were no clouds interrupting that line tonight. "Or, what I'm currently believing is the most plausible answer: the timing of what I noticed happened to be such that it led me astray..."

An expression somewhere between confusion and fright grew on his face as he continued to talk and to think.

"...almost as if I was purposefully led away from the real cause by my subconscious...or something pretending to be my subconscious."

His friend let out a short laugh, then went silent when the haunted expression turned his way. The friend cleared his throat, at a loss for what to say. The friend had wondered why he had been acting strangely—but only for a brief moment. Sometimes he just acted strangely for no apparent reason.

"Everyone has those days, man." The friend tried to smile without judgement, hoping it came across as comforting; reassuring. "Everyone's subconscious gets compromised at some point, usually at many points...whether by some sort of virunetics or bug in the kernel—or the base OS—or somewhere higher up—above more of the abstractions." The friend chuckled, though accidentally made it sound mirthless and cold.

His friend saw his face change into an almost comical mixture of relief and confusion.

"No idea why, but that is actually good to hear—though it does give me tons of shiv to think about and figure out." He looked back out over the now-black ocean beyond the dark sand. "I think I'd already convinced myself...and if you had denied that something could be _that_ wrong..."

He chuckled, "...you know how I am with conspiracies."
