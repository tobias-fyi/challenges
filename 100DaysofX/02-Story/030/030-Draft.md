"Some sort of prospice, whether internal or external, seems to be the underpinning of all cosmic societies—somewhat obvious, I know. But, like I said at the outset, to get to a level of understanding, it's important for us to get the low-hanging fruit, so to speak, out of the way," the Professor said, speaking loudly to the tiered lecture hall; he did not like to use voice amplification.

"However, for those civilizations that almost reach the cosmos, that prospice stops, in most cases, soon after...well," the Professor paused for a brief moment, looking thoughtfully into the space in front of him, "I should say it this way instead—it seems almost a given that in every one of these societies there are a decreasing number of those who continue to create the situational innovation that brought them up to potentially a cosmic level of technological advancement, and there are those who become stuck in their ways."

    CWS-030 ~ "The division between these two groups is not always due to physical or geographical differences. Indeed, the most common is between generations."

"Old tech that still works—" a series of holoslides showed primitive technology, some of which defied description, "—still does what it is supposed to—what it was built for, yet is harmful to them or their environment." The Professor turned off the slides, light returning to his face. "This would seem to be less of a civilization-wide issue than our data show is the case. When compounded by the billions of individuals, such inefficiencies are an important part of their downfall."

"Another way of putting it is with an analogy—they never opened the windows to clear out the stale air which they deep down knew they smelled, but consciously decided to ignore. Simply put, they suffocated themselves to death by acting out their cultural norms without thinking about what they were doing."

"Once the majority of individuals do and say things out of a sense of obligation more than anything else, the slope to self-destruction steadily gets steeper."

"Once the individual loses the individual feeling in their actions and gestures, they begin accumulating societal relics; artifacts. Each generation does something new, then once they become 'known for it', they stop progressing..."
