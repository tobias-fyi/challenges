## Background

### Notes

    CWS-015 | Concepts ~ the dichotomy of esoteric (designed for the specially initiated alone) and exoteric (suitable to be imparted to the public) would be fun to explore with two separate stories that bring the two sides to light in both good and bad ways

    CWS-015 | Goal ~ I started telling a little bit of the Vana storyline in 005 / Lossless by setting a scene of the aftermath of the initial violence. I really want to get into Outside (initiative | order | combine | commission | expedition | pursuit | operation | council | elect | organization | company | concern | group | section | relation | interaction). Outside is the espionage and intelligence group within the Opalian Proximate (formerly Annelo Syndicate) that was unknown and unimportant until the Vana situation began. Once the news reached Opalia, Outside began recruiting more heavily.

    CWS-015 | Device ~ Disyrm is condemning through faint praise. The Opalian Proximate is a society of abundance and liberty, with few, if any, actual laws. I am very heavily influenced by Iain M. Banks' sci-fi series The Culture, and wanted to explore my own version of that kind of society. The society generally looks down upon any kind of purposeful secrecy or coercion, yet deep down know that without it, they would not be able to have their freedom and abundance.

    CWS-015 | Other possible devices: Epanorthosis (retraction of statement in order to intensify it); Noema (stating something obscurely, forcing listeners to figure it out - I just love that word / I think I used it already but oh well); Synchoresis (concession made for the sake of more effective retort); Syllogism (argument in which two premises lead to a logical conclusion). I haven't been particularly good at using the devices I lay out, but it's still interesting to keep them in mind.

### Setting

The Society

- Officially declared themselves as a distinct civilization 984 standard years prior
- Population is in the range of 600 billion
  - 100 systems totaling less than 100 inhabited planets
  - Many thousands of artificial (articial) habitats mostly clustered around the systems

I don't think Opalian Proximate will be the name of the overarching civilization that I've been describing, as that is more of a microcosm within the greater society. I want it to be like The Culture, a general term that describes some sort of commonality; common future.

This story takes place on one of the wonders of the Opalian Proximate, Ephemeris.

Seeing as I did quite a bit of writing just to build the mental models of the universe, I probably won't write as much actual story this time.

## Esoteris

"I think the blue might be a bit strong," Staz said. He was hanging upside down, his bare knees hooked over the handle of a trapeze which connected to the underside of a archway. He swung slowly back and forth as he considered the blue and red stripes of the munclay, allowing the shifting colors in the distance to blur and blend together in his field of vision.

    CWS-015 ~ Munclay is the material which makes up much of the outer surface of the habitat, on which a spired mansion sits. The name comes from the word humunculus, because the clay-like material is part of an organism. 

"You know where I stand on the matter. Contrast like that is..." The other man squinted and widened his eyes a few times as he swept his gaze over the swirling hills and canyons that stretched out below the edge of the terrace. "...nice. Though I prefer it in much smaller doses when it's this close."

He stepped to the edge of the tiles, dropped to his haunches, and ran a hand along the strangely organic surface of the munclay. Staz followed the hand with his eyes, letting his mind wander. As happened frequently around Loele, his mind reminisced on the satiny softness of the short, neat fur that covered the hand and the body it was attached to. It wasn't difficult to remember the feeling of bliss when the fur enveloped him, tickling his bare skin—it'd happened earlier that day.

He let a shiver work up his spine—or down, as it happened. He refocused his eyes as a dark shimmer moved in front of his view. Loele flicked a small ball of bight blue munclay, hitting Staz in the chest and rolling down to rest on the underside of his chin.

Staz laughed, flexing his body to make himself swing. On the upswing, he jerked his chin, the added  momentum make the dot of color float up past his face. Before he was done rising, his knees straightened and he flipped over the flying blue spot, keeping it in front of his face as if it were his acrobatics partner. He landed in a crouching position as he grabbed the munclay out of the air.

He turned around and saw Loele standing at the furthest point of the terrace, his toes curled over the edge of the tiles and his arm outstretched in front of him, a brilliant red circle between two of his fingers. 

"See, you start losing the pastels at around three kilometers. This one though?" He turned his head back to Staz. "I'd give it at least ten."
