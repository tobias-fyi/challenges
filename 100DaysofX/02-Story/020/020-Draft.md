## Notes

Another story in the same timeline as 018 ~ Miscellanae and 019 ~ Lazaret.

    CWS-020 | Device ~ Anaphora: I've found myself using this a bit over the last week or so, particularly yesterday. Though it's an easy one to recognize, yesterday I was able to think about it while I was writing.

### Settings

Nyle / The Rider rides through the township to his meeting with the engineers and leaders. Flashback / descriptions of what he found at Lake Tsana - massive ruins from an ancient civilization.

### Characters

- Nyle / The Rider - Ranger sent on regular month-long exploration missions
  - Is of two minds when it comes to technology: he enjoys the relaxed pace of life without it but knows how useful it is
- Rall - Gruff and friendly; the only tavern owner / brewer in Rexville
- Evar - Materials researcher, specializing in new-glass
- Olon - The aging ex-owner/captain of the Olonor when it was a ship
  - He was elected by the survivors to be the interim leader of the township in years immediately after landfall
  - After the township stabilized, he stepped down as primary leader, opting instead for a minor seat on the steering council
  - Worn down by the experience of landfall and the years afterwards; not hopeless but not motivated to push others
- Kem o'Mieng - Newly-appointed lead engineer on the reconstitech team
  - Spearheaded the highly successful efforts to build new technology and rekindle the township's interest in scientific inquiry

## Ad-hoc

### :::: 1 ::::

The Rider moved along the packed dirt of the Rexville's shaded streets. He wanted to stop at Tavenor for a cold drink or three, but he knew the council would be expecting his report. And this report was more exciting and important than any he'd come back with previously.

What had seen on the explore was another one of those little miracles.

In fact, the report he was about to relay to the steering council may contain the most important bits of information he'd ever carried by himself. If he was suddenly crushed by a falling metallite strut, which was not beyond the bounds of reason, given the state of the mongrel structure under which he now rode.

He looked up at the mess of metallite that was once a majestic raw-hauler. Light from the local star shone through the outer hull in places, illuminating broken and bent pipes and trusses. The Rider had watched as they all bent in the same direction as the ship rammed through the dozen or so mountain peaks on its way to the valley floor, each successful impact slowing the ship marginally; offsetting different sections of the ship more and more.

It was a miracle he had been strapped to the wall in the precise location that he was. Out of the two hundred or so that had been occupying the same lazaret as him upon landfall, only a handful had survived. He watched as they were crushed and mutilated by shifting metallite and falling debris. Or by not having strong enough straps and being flung against the aft bulkhead in an apparent burst of intense gravitation.

The Rider shook his head, returning his gaze to the buildings in front of him. _This was no little miracle._

This was something big. This could be everything. _This will change everything._

He needed a few minutes of unrelated conversation to loosen his tongue.

_This calls for a drink._

#### CWS-020 | Character Development ~ Practice

    CWS-020 ~ One area of severe weakness for me that I've noticed lately is describing characters. Time to practice!

"The explorer returns!" The large man behind the counter grinned broadly, waving one of his overly large hands to the newcomer. The Rider pushed the door shut behind him, cutting off the slice of outside light that he had brought with him into the ground-level building. He took in the familiar interior as he removed his mask, barely able to make out the bar as his eyes adjusted to the gloom. He welcomed the cool darkness.

"Good to see you, Rall," the Rider said as he made for the bar and the line of seats in front. The other man who sat on a high-backed stool did not turn around as he approached. "Evar, you as well."

Evar looked over as he sat down, a look of barely unbridled glee on his face. "Nyle! Hi...umm...good to see you," the man coughed, seeming to stifle a laugh. He cleared his throat, composing himself. "Looks like you just came in. How was the explore?"

"I'll tell all about it later," Nyle said, taking off his hat. He sat down on another high-backed stool next to Evar, placing the sweat-rimmed hat on the counter next to him. "Right now I am in dire need of refreshment."

Rall grinned even more broadly, which Nyle had doubted was even possible. The man's thick teeth seemed to shine, even in the relative darkness. Rall reached under the counter, giving Evar a knowing look.

"Am I missing something here?" Nyle said, looking back and forth between the two mischevious faces. "Or are you really that happy to see me?"

Evar said nothing, laughter simmering just under the surface.

Rall casually jerked the two arms that had reached under the counter and two shining glasses shot up in front of him. The two hands attached to his primary set of arms caught them easily, spinning each expertly a few times on the broad palms.

Nyle's eyes widened, following one of the glasses as it was brought to a tap and filled with a frothing blue-green liquid. "I see..." He looked back at Evar, a stupid smile spreading across his dirty face.

"Just finished the first ones yesterday. Knew you were coming back so we waited to bring 'em out," Evar said, his eyes sparkling. He raised 

#### CWS-020 ~ Note

    The idea here is that this is the very first time since landfall that anyone in the township could drink out of glasses. No glass was allowed on the ship as it poses a hazard, particularly during potentially high-gravity maneuvers. Evar had been working on a new type of glass which uses the local materials, but was not successful. Until now, that is.

Rall placed a glass in front of each of the seated men, laughing as he watched Nyle cycle through a several emotions in quick succession. Rall passed a third glass to a primary hand, filling that one and holding it up in front of him.

"Glad you made it back to the wreck without turning yourself into one in the process."

They clinked glasses for the first time since before the war began, and drank deep.

    I didn't get to the point where Nyle gives his report. I'll probably write that part tomorrow for 021.

    Cheers! 

"As I've said many times before, this is our chance to start over. If for no other reason than to be able to watch for signs of Domari encroachment. We have no idea where along the Shore we washed up. We are utterly blind as to how far we managed to get from Domari."

"Or _when_ we washed up..."
