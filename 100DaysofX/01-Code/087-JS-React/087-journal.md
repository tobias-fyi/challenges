### 11:33 -+- Session.init

I just listened to an episode of Django Chat where they talked about going to conferences. I wasn't expecting much from the episode but it was actually a great episode and led me to look up videos from DjangoCons of the last couple of years. I had not thought to look for videos from these events, and there are a ton of them! I'll list out a few of the ones that I think look interesting...

### 11:53 ~ Winners WarmUp

I've found the whole "warming up" concept to be a good one in development. My ultimate goal today is to put in good work on the Motif project, but I'm going to warm up by finishing Corey Schafer's BeautifulSoup video I was watching last night.

This time, I'm going to set a time limit for my warmup exercises. I don't want to spend all day on the warmup when Motif is waiting!

Actually...Flippootty Floopitty things it's better to just get started with Motif. There's always the chance that if I get into a flow with another project, I will be hard-pressed to switch gears into Motif-land.

### 13:16 ~ Rataplan React Resources

[How to Learn React - A Roadmap from Beginner to Advanced](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-react-roadmap-from-scratch-to-advanced-bff7735531b6/)

Here are some (paid) resources for learning React:

- Level Up Tuts
  - Go Pro for $15 / month (annually = $180) or $20 / month (monthly)
  - I think this is a really really good idea - probably the best paid option so far - at least as far as javascript / React
  - He doesn't have any Python tutorials but has much of the rest of the tech I want to be using + other topics that I'd like to at least peruse
    - React (tons of aspects + levels of it)
    - GraphQL
    - UX / UI Design
    - More advanced CSS / JS / more
- Wes Bos
  - [React for Beginners Course](https://reactforbeginners.com/) ($97)
  - [Advanced React Course](https://advancedreact.com/) ($97)
  - These don't utilize Python as the backend, which is really what I'd like to learn
  - I'll do some searching for that specific stack
- TestDriven.io
  - [MicroServices with Docker, Flask, and React](https://testdriven.io/courses/microservices-with-docker-flask-and-react/) (Course - $40)
  - This one looks very promising for what I'd like to learn and is only $40 - taught by [Michael Herman](https://testdriven.io/authors/herman/)
  - Here are the technologies used/learned:
    - Python
    - Flask
    - Docker
    - Postgres
    - Node and NPM
    - React
    - Cypress
    - Swagger
    - AWS
  - Most importantly, however, is the focus on TDD / testing / Code Quality
  - Here's a related mini-course (free) on [TDD with Flaskr](https://github.com/mjhea0/flaskr-tdd)
- [Traversy Media](https://www.traversymedia.com/) of course has all of his Udemy Courses - each one only $10
  - React Front to Back
  - Django Dev to Deployment

Here are some free resources for React + Django / Flask:

- ValentinoG: [Django REST with React](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/drf/)
- [egghead React](https://egghead.io/browse/frameworks/react) + more
- Statsbot [Saleor Dashboard Tutorial](https://statsbot.co/blog/adding-analytics-dashboard-to-ecommerce-web-app-with-cube.js-saleor-example)

### 14:36 ~ Django DecisionTime Framework

I've decided at least on one resource I'm going to pursue, and that is Level Up Tuts. I'm going to see if it would be possible to get the basics without a pro subscription, but would be open to buying a subscription for a few months.

My current path will be to utilize some of the free resources + Level Up Tuts + Testdriven Microservices Course

---

### 14:57 ~ Welcome to the Fineyedesign Show

The podcast will be titled Fine Eyed Design.

The first session (season / series) will be "Understanding Saleor 2.0"

In order to understand what is going on inside of [Saleor](https://getsaleor.com/), I'm going on a journey to gather a working knowledge in the underlying technologies that make it possible:

- Python + Django
- Docker + Postgres
- React + TypeScript
- GraphQL + Apollo
- Sass + PostCSS + Webpack module bundler + misc others

The paid resources that I'll be utilizing in order to achieve this are:

- Level Up Tutorials
  - Front-end technologies + GraphQL + others
- TestDriven [dot] io course on Microservices with React + Flask + Docker

On top of whatever free resources I find as I go along. Here are some to get me started:

- ValentinoG: [Django REST with React](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/drf/)
- Statsbot [Saleor Dashboard Tutorial](https://statsbot.co/blog/adding-analytics-dashboard-to-ecommerce-web-app-with-cube.js-saleor-example)
- [Learn React Roadmap](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-react-roadmap-from-scratch-to-advanced-bff7735531b6/)
  - [Beginner's Guide to React by Kent C. Dodds](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react) on Egghead
  - [React Fundamentals](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/all-the-fundamental-react-js-concepts-jammed-into-this-single-medium-article-c83f9b53eac2/)
  - [Fetching API Data with React](https://blog.hellojs.org/fetching-api-data-with-react-js-460fe8bbf8f2)

----ƒ----

Let's get started!

---

### 16:22 ~ Level 1

Learning the Fundamentals of React and the Django REST Framework.

Starting things off with this tutorial...once I get a fundamental understanding of React, which I will get from Level Up Tuts.

First LUT series I'm going to try out is "React 16 for Everyone".

This speaker buzz is really annoying though...I think there's too much power next to the speaker cables. That or there is a ground loop in the studio somewhere.

Oh well. I can't spend the time on that right now.

### 16:29 ~ React 16 For Everyone

Getting started with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)...

    ╭─ motif » tobiasfyi » ~/workshop/motif                                         19.05.29 ∫ 16:36:40
    ╰─ nvm use node
    Now using node v12.3.1 (npm v6.9.0)

    ╭─ motif » tobiasfyi » ~/workshop/motif                                         19.05.29 ∫ 16:36:49
    ╰─ npm install -g create-react-app
    /Users/Tobias/.nvm/versions/node/v12.3.1/bin/create-react-app -> /Users/Tobias/.nvm/versions/node/v12.3.1/lib/node_modules/create-react-app/index.js
    + create-react-app@3.0.1
    added 91 packages from 45 contributors in 10.415s

I gotta decide if I want to follow along 1 for 1 with the tutorial or if I want to try to utilize the GoodReads API, or some other similar API.

I'm going to try creating a Book app first. If that fails I'll resort to whatever API that Scott uses in the tutorial.

    Time to check out the Vible from the Vibrary.

#### 16:45 ~ Vibrarian

Bummer that vibrary.com is taken. Anyways...back to the project—my very first [React](https://reactjs.org/) project!

First things first, I created a new project directory for vibrary...

    ╭─ tobiasfyi » ~/workshop                                                    19.05.29 ∫ 16:54:26
    ╰─ mkproject vibrary
    ...
    Creating /Users/Tobias/workshop/vibrary
    Setting project for vibrary to /Users/Tobias/workshop/vibrary

    ╭─ vibrary » tobiasfyi » ~/workshop/vibrary                                  19.05.29 ∫ 16:56:43
    ╰─ create-react-app vibrary
    Creating a new React app in /Users/Tobias/workshop/vibrary/vibrary.
    ...
    added 1541 packages from 747 contributors and audited 888971 packages in 114.756s
    found 0 vulnerabilities
    Initialized a git repository.
    Success! Created vibrary at /Users/Tobias/workshop/vibrary/vibrary
    Inside that directory, you can run several commands:
    npm start
        Starts the development server.
    npm run build
        Bundles the app into static files for production.
    npm test
        Starts the test runner.
    npm run eject
        Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
        and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!
    We suggest that you begin by typing:

    cd vibrary
    npm start

    Happy hacking!

Aww how cute! I will be happy hacking.

I ran `npm start` and viola!

    Compiled successfully!
    You can now view vibrary in the browser.
    Local:            http://localhost:3000/
    On Your Network:  http://10.0.0.144:3000/

#### 17:04 ~ Initial Files

Index.js inserts the application into the DOM. App.js is where the main coding will take place. This is jsx - combination of html and js.

Relatively basic stuff. I do want to get into the SVG book. Opened it up to remind me.

#### 17:13 ~ First React Components

> vibrary/src/App.js

In true front-end fashion, the syntax has already changed a bit since this tutorial series was recorded. However, I can see the logic of the difference. Instead of having a class instance with the render method being defined inside, the render method is already defined and is called on the function `App()`, which is the basis of App.js.

The curly brackets can have values of other variables and such inside.

    const welcome = 'Learn Reactionism';
    ...
    >
        {welcome}
    </a>

However, now that we're getting into creating components, I'm not sure where the correlation is...Scott uses a class to instantiate a component. Given that the class is not used in the `App()` function (component?), I'm guessing it won't be used to create other components.

[Reading through the docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) to figure it out.

#### 17:37 ~ React Elements

[React elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html) are the smallest building blocks of a react app. An element describes what should be seen on the screen. Elements combine to create [components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html).

#### 17:44 ~ Components and Props

Aha...there it is.

    Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs ("props") and return react elements describing what should appear on the screen.

Ok so the class can still be used to define a component. That means I can follow along with the tutorials easily. I guess it's just a change in the default. I managed to create my own Welcome component and render it to the page.

```javascript
function App() {
    return (
        <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
            <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
            <Welcome name="Tobias" />;
        </header>
        </div>
    );
}

class Welcome extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>Welcome to the Vibrary, {this.props.name}</h1>
    }
}
```

Buenos JayEssExx, Amigas!
