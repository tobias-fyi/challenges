---- Sojourn ----

### 11:18 ~ Lost Hours 4 Lyfe

Another session of logo design. Lost track of time a little bit - got caught up doing tiny little things...need to get better at that. Got some cool designs going though for sure!

![Lost Time Logo](fyi-logo-v2.png)

Some of those have some definite potential. I'll have to get some outside perspective...

### 11:30 ~ StartProject Sebastomania

Sebastomania: religious insanity.

Before getting to the development phase of this project, I'm going to spend a little time (20+ minutes) sketching out...

- My ideas for the site / application
- What I want the featureset and UI / UX to look like
  - The base functionality that I can get up in time for the next challenge
  - The extended functionality that will be on-going
    - I think it's important to not only note what I want to implement during the first phase because, at least ideally, being able to say that a feature will be implemented in phase 2 or 3 will let me be more realistic with phase 1
    - Or, put another way, it's the MVP vs long-term vs stretch goals

---

#### 11:49 ~ StartProject Stereobate

Stereobate: substructure; foundation; basement.

I'm going to try to break out all the features I eventually want to have on the Fineyedesign site, then start with the most basic ones that I need to get the site up and running in time for June 13th / #100DaysofText.

#### The Basics, Part 1

At the very least, Fineyedesign needs the following pages / functionality, which are not necessarily actually separate pages:

- Pages App
  - Home page
  - List of Posts (articles + photos / designs)
  - Individual Post pages
  - Emailing List signup form
    - [MailChimp API](https://developer.mailchimp.com/)
    - [MailerLite API](https://developers.mailerlite.com/docs)
  - Names / Words
    - Display
    - Displaid
    - Radix: root; root-number or numerical base; root word or stem
    - Rheme: speech element that expresses an idea
    - Synsemantic: of a word, having no meaning outside a specific context
    - Etymon: true origin of a word
    - Euphonism: custom of using pleasing sounding words
    - Euphonym: euphonious synonym
    - Eutony: pleasantness of the sound of a word

---- ∫ ----

#### The Basics, Part 2

- Portfolio / Showcase App
  - Creatively Render
    - Designs
    - Panoramas
  - Downloadable Assets
    - Wallpapers
    - Printables
  - Names
    - Depict
    - Impart
    - Commove
    - Calligram: design using the letters of a word.

---- ∫ ----

#### Intermediate

Some mid-project functionality / pages...

- Custom email newsletter that integrates with and extends the site
- User Accounts
- Simple online store to sell digital products
- Timeline (interactive, maybe?)
- Custom Pano viewer

---- ∫ ----

#### Advanced

- Advanced User Accounts and User Forums
  - Cryptonym: secret name
  - Aptronym: name that suits its owner
- Add physical products to online store (prints of my designs and panos, to start out)
- Fully custom content platform for interactive articles and artwork
- Integration with tobias.fyi

---

### 18:31 ~ Some Thotz

"Find books for your readers, not readers for your books."

...wow that statement right there...incredibly simple idea that creates the slightest change in perception which makes all the difference.

That is how I should be looking at creating my content.

Oh yeah—it was a quote from and episode of Seth Godin's podcast, [Akimbo](https://www.akimbo.me/).

---

### 21:02 ~ My Temporal Space Thumomancy

Thumomancy: divination by means of one's own soul.
Thymogenic: due to emotion.

#### 21:03 ~ Thymogenic Productivity

What productivity is *not* due to emotion of one sort or another? Starting up the Django app now...after spending 20+ minutes recording audio for the podcast / audio journal.

    ╭─ Fineyedesign » tobiasfyi » ..cts/fineyedesign »  master ● ?              19.06.09 ∫ 21:05:24
    ╰─ django-admin startproject fineyedesign .

#### 21:06 ~ Toponym

Toponym: place name derived from geographical feature. The idea is that I need to come up with a name for the initial publishing application. I really like the one that I used for the journaling feature a couple of months ago - sojourn. I'm not sure though...I feel like I could do better. Though I guess it doesn't matter too much. I don't want to get caught up with this and not work on the actual build.

Yup, I like sojourn enough to use it. And I believe that I used Sajourn before, as it was a contraction of Smartass Journal.

    drwxr-xr-x  3 Tobias  staff    96B Jun  8 00:35 static

Now time to let Django know that I created that thurr new application, and should use it, goddamnit!

Also, just randomly came across [Poker Alice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker_Alice) while looking through the Cowboy Bebop wikipedia page for more name inspiration.

    After the death of her first husband, Alice started to play poker seriously. Alice was in a tough financial position. After failing in a few different jobs including teaching, she turned to poker to support herself financially. Alice would make money by gambling and working as a dealer. Ivers made a name for herself by winning money from poker games. By the time Ivers was given the name "Poker Alice," she was drawing in large crowds to watch her play and men were constantly challenging her to play. Saloon owners liked that Ivers was a respectable woman who kept to her values. These values included her refusal to play poker on Sundays.

    As her reputation grew, so did the amount of money she was making. Some nights she would even make $6,000, an incredibly large sum of money at the time. Alice claimed that she won $250,000, which would now be worth more than three million dollars.

    Ivers used her good looks to distract men at the poker table. She always had the newest dresses, and even in her 50s was considered a very attractive woman. She was also very good at counting cards and figuring odds, which helped her at the table.

    Alice was known always to have carried a gun with her, preferably her .38, and frequently smoked cigars.

What a badass...

#### 21:18 ~ Initial Additions

> fineyedesign > settings.py

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    ...
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    "fineyedesign.apps.SojournConfig",
]
```

#### 21:23 ~ Estiferous Back-End

Estiferous: producing heat.
Elytriferous: having or bearing hardened forewings.

Time to get an instance of Postgres up and grooving. Created a new Postgres server after cleaning out some of the older ones in the list. Always nice to dejunk.

    postgres=# CREATE DATABASE somedb;
    CREATE DATABASE
    postgres=# CREATE ROLE 'someadmin' WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD '***$3cR3T***';
    ERROR:  syntax error at or near "'someadmin'"
    LINE 1: CREATE ROLE 'someadmin' WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD '***$3cR3T***';
                        ^
    postgres=# CREATE USER 'someadmin' WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD '***$3cR3T***';
    ERROR:  syntax error at or near "'someadmin'"
    LINE 1: CREATE USER 'someadmin' WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD '***$3cR3T***';
                        ^
    postgres=# CREATE USER someadmin WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD '***$3cR3T***';
    CREATE ROLE
    postgres=# \c somedb someadmin
    You are now connected to database "somedb" as user "someadmin".

I want to do as much of this from memory as possible. That's why I did that...

Decided to finally update my pgAdmin to v4.8 - from v4.3.

Although I do want to do as much as possible from memory I'm not going to wait around too long if I'm spinning my wheels on remembering something. For example, the database settings. For this build, I'm going to use environment variables. I hope to be able to use envirovars in the production build as well, as this time I'll be learning how to implement an nginx server.

> ~/.vega/Fineyedesign/bin/postactivate

```bash
# ================== Django ================== #
export SECRET_KEY="*********"
export DEBUG_MODE="True"
export DB_ENGINE="django.db.backends.postgresql"
export DB_NAME="somedb"
export DB_USER="someadmin"
export DB_PASS="***$3cR3T***"
export DB_HOST="localhost"
export DB_PORT="5432"
```

> ~/.vega/Fineyedesign/bin/postdeactivate

```bash
# ================== Django ================== #
unset SECRET_KEY
unset DEBUG_MODE
unset DB_ENGINE
unset DB_NAME
unset DB_USER
unset DB_PASS
unset DB_HOST
unset DB_PORT
```

Then I updated the settings with the new database connection strings.

```python
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": os.environ.get("DB_ENGINE"),
        "NAME": os.environ.get("DB_NAME"),
        "USER": os.environ.get("DB_USER"),
        "PASSWORD": os.environ.get("DB_PASS"),
        "HOST": os.environ.get("DB_HOST"),
        "PORT": os.environ.get("DB_PORT"),
    }
}
```

#### 21:53 ~ Moonraker Migration

Moonraker: topmost sale of a ship, above the skyscraper.

Now that the database is all set up and the settings reflect the changes, I believe I can migrate the database now.

Well I guess the installed apps line I write in was incorrect...

    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fineyedesign.apps'

Hmm....everything seems right...except NOT! I put the name of the project instead of the name of the app.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    "sojourn.apps.SojournConfig",
]
```

Another error, this time I think it's because I didn't activate the envirovars first...

    django.db.utils.OperationalError: FATAL:  role "blablahadminuserblah" does not exist

Let's try this again...

    Quit the server with CONTROL-C.

...so *go catch it!*

I caught it! Good ol firefox catching me some servers and such. Now I get to come up with some models to structure my data. How excite!

---

### 22:32 ~ PhaseOne.init

#### 22:43 ~ Static Templates

Gotta get the favicon.ico goin'. Copied over the 100px version of the open logo then renamed to favicon.png. But first, I gotta set things up so the static files are available project-wide. And while I'm at it, might as well set that up for the templates as well.

```python
TEMPLATES = [
    {
        "BACKEND": "django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates",
        "DIRS": [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "templates")],
        ...
      ...
    }
]
...
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static_assets/")
STATIC_URL = "/static/"
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static")]
```

Man my computer was really chugging when I had the Django server running. iTerm was going between 50% and +100% on the activity monitor. No bueno.

Debating whether I want to use Bootstrap or not. I think I will to start out and see if I want to create my own styles at a later point.

Created the first template `base.html` using the bootstrap template.

#### 22:53 ~ Mabsoot Macadamized Model

Macadamize: to cover a road with small broken stones.
Mabsoot: happy.

#### LVL2-fyi : fyi.func - markdown to html  

Starting it out simple and in-line with what Sir William has in the book. But I want to change something so I'm not coding *exactly* what's in the book. That's an easy way to not understand what I'm doing.

- Thread
- Article
- Episode
- Jib
- Ley: mystical straight line between features of landscape
- **Rep: plain-woven fabric with crosswise ribs
- Wis: to know; to believe
- Item: likewise, also

Digging thread...but also rep—it also has the metaphor of doing reps while physically working out. Using that...

> sojourn/models.py

```python
from django.db import models

class Rep(models.Model):  # A rep like doing reps at the gym or building reputation
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.ForeignKey('auth.User', on_delete=models.CASCADE,)
    body = models.TextField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

- Imports the class `models`
- Creates subclass of `models.Model`
  - Access to everything within `django.db.models.Models`
  - Add additional fields and methods as desired
  - I get more ClassPractice! How [super()](https://realpython.com/python-super/)
  - CCBV - for looking through the [Django CBV Source Code](http://ccbv.co.uk/projects/Django/2.1/)
- ForeignKey = many-to-one

I didn't want to have to turn off word wrap in vscode every time, so I set up a rule for python files in `settings.py`...

```python
"[python]": {
    "editor.tabSize": 4,
    "editor.wordWrap": "off"
},
```

Time to migrate some more models! First created the migration file, then looked at it, then completed the migration like a dangdarn frigatebird.

#### 23:35 ~ Admin Anomia

Anomia: inability to remember names.
Anonymuncule: minor anonymous writer.

Now it's time to get the admin page up and running. Superusers unite!

    ╭─ Fineyedesign » tobiasfyi » ..cts/fineyedesign »  master ● ?      19.06.09 ∫ 23:38:19

    Superuser created successfully.

Update the admin code to include the new `Rep` model...

> sojourn/admin.py

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Rep

admin.site.register(Rep)
```

I decided to disable the MarkdownLint Extension for this workspace as well.

Tried to run the server and ran into a weird error. I guess I still have the onform_admin user floating around in the system somewhere?

    File "/Users/Tobias/.vega/Fineyedesign/lib/python3.7/site-packages/psycopg2/__init__.py", line 126, in connect
      conn = _connect(dsn, connection_factory=connection_factory, **kwasync)
    django.db.utils.OperationalError: FATAL:  role "onform_admin" does not exist

---- ∫ ----

Ok good...had to reload and try out some things to get the tab situation to start working again for this markdown file. When I disabled the linter, it somehow changed the tab size to 4. Spent a while fixing it.

I believe I know why that error came up though. I don't think I sourced the postactivate script on that terminal window...and I was correct!

    ╭─ Fineyedesign » tobiasfyi » ..cts/fineyedesign »  master ● ?      19.06.09 ∫ 23:54:14

....and...I'm in! I know kung fu... ....

But really though....

This time, I'm adding the initial data via the admin site, not via SQL query like I'd done before, though I might do that as well just for good measure. I'd hafta figure out how to add the user.id...

### 00:03 ~ Onwards to Apophasis

Apophasis: saying something by stating that you will not mention it.

#### 00:05 ~ URLs

    ╭─ Fineyedesign » tobiasfyi » ..cts/fineyedesign »  master ● ?      19.06.09 ∫ 23:59:15
    ╰─ touch sojourn/urls.py

```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import RepListView

urlpatterns = [path("", RepListView.as_view(), name="home")]
```

> fineyedesign/urls.py

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [path("admin/", admin.site.urls), path("", include("sojourn.urls"))]
```

And as it should, the log says it cannot import the view...because reasons...

    ImportError: cannot import name 'RepListView' from 'sojourn.views' (/Users/Tobias/workshop/Fineyedesign/08-Projects/fineyedesign/sojourn/views.py)

#### 00:11 ~ Velary Views

Velary: pertaining to the sails of a ship.
Velar: of sounds, produced using the soft palate.
Velar: dome terminated by four or more walls.

Time to get *Classy*!

> sojourn/views.py

```python
from django.views.generic import ListView
from .models import Rep

class RepListView(ListView):
    model = Rep
    template_name = "home.html"
```

Unfortunately the logo doesn't show up well on the dark background. I'll have to either put a background behind it or make it a lighter color.

I guess it's not as easy to pass in a title to the template as it is with Flask. I looked around a little bit but couldn't find anything, except that the [Jinja2 Docs](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#template-inheritance) use the same method I'd used before in the examples.

#### 01:11 ~ Styles and Such

Spent probably the last hour playing around with styles and logos to get a good theme going. I exported the logo series again with a light theme - now I have white and offwhite options.

#### 01:21 ~ Winding Witherling

Witherling: withered or decrepit person; an adversary.

I'm ready to start winding down now so I can continue working on this tomorrow and the next day. At least I got something up! Time to start thinking about some sweet design features.

Hasta Windward, Amish!
