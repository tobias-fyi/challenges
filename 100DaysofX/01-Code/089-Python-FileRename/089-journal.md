### 12:03 ~ Relict Reminders Reliquiae

I was going through my photos to find more clouds when I ran across some I took of 'The War of Art'. I thought it would be valuable to write one of the passages in here...

#### The Artist's Life

    Are you a born writer? Were you put on earth to be a painter, a scientist, an apostle of peace? In the end the question can only be answered by action.

    Do it or don't do it.

    It may help to think of it this way. If you were meant to cure cancewr or write a symphony or crack cold fusion and you don't do it, you not only hurt yourself, even destroy yourself. You hurt your children. You hurt me. You hurt the planet.

    You shame the angels who watch over you and you spite the Almighty, who created you and only you with your unique gifts, for the sole purpose of nudging the human race one millimeter farther along its path back to God.

    Creative work is not a selfish act or a bid for attention on the part of the actor. It's a gift to the world and every being on it. Don't cheat us of your contribution. Give us what you've got.

Aside from the part about the Almighty, I really like this passage. I remember when I realized this at a deep level for one for the first times. It was at Pretty Lights when I went with Kelsey, and Lauren and Will, right after we all moved to Colorado. I realized that without people who make art and put themselves out there to be creative and unique, the world could potentially be a very dark and lonely place.

It is creativity that gives us inspiration; inspiration that gives us ingenuity. Our ingenuity has given us the progress we've had thus far...let's not fuck it up.

#### Psychological Territory

    We humans have our own territories whether we realize it or not. Ours are psychological. Stevie Wonder's territory is the piano.

    What are the qualities of a territory?

1. *A territory provides sustenance.* The swimmer who towels off after finishing her laps feels a helluva lot better than the tired, cranky person who dove into the pool thirty minutes earlier.
2. *A territory sustains us without any external input.* A territory is a closed feedback loop. Our role is to put in effort and love; the territory absorbs this and gives it back to us in the form of well-being.
3. *A territory can only be claimed alone.* You can team with a partner, you can work out with a friend, but you only need yourself to soak up your territory's juice.
4. *A territory can only be claimed by work.* A territory doesn't give; a territory gives back.
5. *A territory returns exactly what you put in.* Territories are fair. Every erg of energy you put in goes infallibly into your account. A territory never devalues. A territory never crashes. What you deposited, you get back, dollar-for-dollar.

    A territory doesn't give; a territory gives back.

    What's your territory?

#### Trust

#### CUE-151 ~ Trust is the union of intelligence and integrity

### 12:24 ~ Time for Coffee

----ƒ----

### 12:44 -+- Fineyedesign.init

I just added a few lines to the fyinit code to allow me to use the return key to choose the current directory. This might be a little more complicated than it needs to be, but it works.

```python
index = input()
if index:
    index = int(index)
    root = dir_list[index]
else:
    root = index

if root == "cwd" or root == "":
    break
```

### 13:20 ~ Meditation Masticate

### 13:49 ~ Exercise or ExtraSize

After meditating I did a quick exercise session with the bands. Something I need to do much more of going forward. I recently made the conscious decision—set the intention—that I want to have the most healthy and beautiful body I can. Although it is self-centered of me to make the decision based on the beautiful aspect, I don't think it's a bad justification for keeping up a workout routine.

The main thing is I want to keep my body healthy so my brain can work at its full capacity. I think some of my issues regarding post-meal lethargy and the like have to do with not working out enough.

As far as the beautiful body thing goes, I feel like I'm not taking any advantage of the fact that I've been blessed with great genetics. Not the best, by any means. But not the worst, either. My body looks pretty darn good without me doing much, so what would it look like if I trained hard? 

Probably much better. I don't even know because I've never tried under my own force of will. Most of the times when I went to the gym a lot it was because I had something or someone else that was causing me to go. Not always, but when I really pushed myself in the past it was because of this.

### 13:55 ~ Methesis Motif

Mathesis: Mental discipline; learning or wisdom.

I'm uploading some new designs to the OneDrive right now. However, I wanted to rename them—take out the leading date. I guess I don't really have to but I want to have them just be `motif-logo_v2-*.png`.

I copied the Python dirs_capitalize script I wrote last week (I think) and am going to use that as a base for the script to rename these.

I didn't want to change directories when activating the venv in a new iTerm tab, so [I found the option](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_ref.html#workon) that allows me to do that.

    ╭─ tobiasfyi » ..on/File_Dir_Mgmt »  master ● ?                      19.05.31 ∫ 14:13:22
    ╰─ workon -n Fineyedesign

That's nice to know! Just adding the `-n` flag does it.

----ƒ----

Dope! Got it to work.

Directories have been renamed!

For posterity...here's the Python code:

# -- Removes leading date from files - #
# ----- within target directory ------ #

def rename():
    import os
    import time

    work_dir = (
        "some/current/working/directory/that/has/the/files.png"
    )

    with os.scandir(work_dir) as files:
        for f in files:
            if not f.name.startswith(".") and not f.is_dir():
                f_path, f_name = os.path.split(f)
                filename, f_ext = os.path.splitext(f_name)
                f_split = filename.split("-")

                new_name = f_split[3] + f_ext
                print(f"Renaming {f_name} to {new_name}.")
                new_file = os.path.join(f_path, new_name)
                os.rename(f, new_file)

    time.sleep(0.5)
    print("Directories have been renamed!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    rename()
```

### 15:09 ~ Motif Branding Bardocucullus

Bardocucullus: hooded cloak worn by monks.

I've been having great graphic ideas for Motif after designing that logo last night. It inspired me a lot more than I would've ever thought.

---

### 20:56 ~ Hot Dayum Lost Man

Just lost myself in that logo design session for what...almost 5 hours.

Yep. Made some pretty dope shit though.

...I think. I guess I'll see tomorrow.

Going to vape a bit then pass out. I guess not React for me today, unfortunately. I'll put a screenshot of the logos here for reference.

Ugh the export doesn't look good. Didn't use the art optimized / supersampling export mode...but that means I can just screenshot the aartboards straight from illustrator so everything is on one page.

![I'm an Iterative Designer](assets/iterative_designer.png)

Quite the clusterfuck of iterations, eh?

Buenos Nachos, Amigos!
