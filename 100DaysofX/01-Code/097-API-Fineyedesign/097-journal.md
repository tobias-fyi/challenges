---- Sojourn ----

### 10:00 -+- session.init

Logged onto GMB + Bing + Yelp for one of my clients. It would be sweet to have some sort of framework for quickly gathering data on how each page / post is getting traffic and interaction, then displaying that in an easy-to-read way. Furthermore, it would help to have them all analyzed in such a way that I can know what my first steps should be when working on this project.

I guess one way to begin setting this up would be to find out if what APIs exist I can hit up for this data.

### 10:18 ~ APIs - Assiduity for Palzogony Imbrication

#### IDEA-157 : Iterum acronym function - plug in acronym and get back words / defs  

Changed the color of the background in iTerm because that blue was very dark. Just in case, here's the Hex for the old blue:

#### CUE--159 ~ iTerm-darkNavy-Hex: #001029  

---- § ----

Here are my results from doing some quick research into the API functionality for the listings...

Bing: Negatory

Must be part of the trusted partners program to use the API. Must be a huge agency with strict data quality checks to be eligible for the program. Verdict: NOPE. However, if I really wanted to, I could probably find a way to scrape the data directly from the site.

---- § ----

[Yelp Fusion API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started): Affirmative

I don't think this API will be of much use for us. The endpoints and data we would get back are not particularly valuable for what we want to do. However, I may change my mind on that, as it is possible to pull down [details and reviews](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business). What I'm looking for right now, however, is being able to automate the gathering of data and the posting of content.

I guess I didn't really look to see if I could pull down traffic and other data...doing that now. I still don't see anything like that anywhere.

---- § ----

[Google My Business](https://developers.google.com/my-business/): Affirmative

Good ol' Google...the API seems to be similar to any of their other APIs. God damnit Google...why do you have to have everything and be so good at it all?

It looks like it is possible to get the [basic insights about a location](https://developers.google.com/my-business/content/insight-data#basic_insights). That page doesn't get into the specific metrics, but I imagine that the metrics are listed out somewhere.

The other aspect I wanted to find is how to use the API to post content. That information is available on the ["Posts on Google" page](https://developers.google.com/my-business/content/posts-data). Google also has an article on how to [access the API using Python](https://developers.google.com/my-business/content/python).

URI stands for Uniform Resource Identifier...I learn something new every day. Also, JSP = Java Server Pages.

### 21:10 ~ Embryogenesis

It's time to begin anew. There's not much more I can do for Motif at this point, and things are relatively quiet on a lot of fronts right now.

As my next 100 Day Challenge is starting very soon, I've been thinking about it frequently. Aside from organizing my notes into daily journals to finish off this challenge, I'm starting to gear up for the next one: writing.

I decided on my long walk today that, for my next 100-Day Challenge I'm not only going to write fiction. I'm going to simply write whatever is inspiring me that day. Also, to give those writings a place to live in the public intersphere, I decided to keep practicing my Django and React skills by finishing the first prototype of my own publishing platorm in time for the Challenge to begin.

#### CUE--159 : Good celtic soundtrack music  

The site will be the start of my Fineyedesign brand. That by itself is very exciting. All of it is very exciting...I'm excited!

I have the React Level 2 from Level Up Tuts to watch, tons of great Django resources.

### 21:51 ~ The Beloid Setup Blues

Beloid: shaped like an arrow. As in —> always pointed in a direction -> pointed forward. [Merriam-Webster API.](https://dictionaryapi.com/products/index)

I'm going to utilize the venv that I created for Fineyedesign for this project...well, because it's the Fineyedesign site! Finally getting to Fine Eyed Design. Crazy that I never installed Django...exciting to do it though! It's been too long.

        ╭─ Fineyedesign » tobiasfyi » ..hop/Fineyedesign »  master ● ?               19.06.08 ∫ 21:51:12
        ╰─ pip install django
        ...
        Successfully installed django-2.2.2 sqlparse-0.3.0

        ╭─ Fineyedesign » tobiasfyi » ..hop/Fineyedesign »  master ● ?               19.06.08 ∫ 22:01:06
        ╰─ pip install psycopg2-binary
        ...
        Successfully installed psycopg2-binary-2.8.2

One thing I want to be sure of is to not mess up the git repo somehow by accidentally tracking the Postgres DB or something to that effect.

### 22:35 ~ BackTask Henism

Henism: doctrine that there is only one kind of existence.

Ok back to the task at hand...ooooh...

I really like that phrase...

#### IDEA-159 : Back to the Task at hand | Task at Hand  

So now I get to really start working on the brand! Fineyedesign...I will fine the Fine I in Design.

I *am* the Fine I in design. For now, I'm going to use one of the sketches I came up with last week. I need to come up with some colors. I feel like I did this recently and found some real nice ones. However, I dont want to spend any time looking around for it.

Time to begin fresh. I turned off nightshift for a bit while I look for the brand colors.

---- ∫ ----

Ahhhh that's right...it was for Vibrary that I found those colors.

### 00:32 ~ Papyraceous Pallette

Papyraceous: like paper; papery.

I found some new colors! This purple in the theme is really working for me. Fawk yaaa.

> ~/workshop/...fineyedesign/static/fyi-main.scss

/* fyi pallette - Hex */
$fyi-1-hex: #401B33;
$fyi-2-hex: #594753;
$fyi-3-hex: #C5D9CA;
$fyi-4-hex: #6E6A62;
$fyi-5-hex: #3D3832;

I'm not so sure about the others though. I'll keep iterating on it later.

---

### 00:37 ~ Intelligent Imagos

Imago: idealized mental image of a person.

I'm going to do the right thing and start winding it down now. I don't think I'll do any more meaningful work tonight. I want to be fresh and ready when I start working on coding this project.

Hasta fuego, amigo!
