TASK√001 : Write Python script to format csv
    CWT√01 : Text > Title Case
    CWT√02 : Phone > XXX-XXX-XXXX
----------------º----------------

----14:47
Ideas for first day:
    - Website
    - Add json functionality to init script
    - Write the csv capitalizer
----------------º----------------

----20:10
Rules & Goals
    - 1 hour spent writing code every single day for 100 days
    - Time that does not count:
        - Watching tutorials, listening to podcasts, or reading (except for when looking for very specific information)
        - Writing the daily post about the code I've written
    - Complete the following courses on edX:
        - HarvardX: CS50W - Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
        - BerkeleyX: Data8.1x - Computational Thinking with Python
----------------º----------------

Starting at 22:00
Writing the script to Title Case csv data.
created new directory for challenge - day
----------------º----------------

----22:15
Used dictionary for filepaths to adhere to pep8's 80 char limit
csv module - DictReaper / DictReader
If time left over, try Pandas to do the same thing.

Python .title() method
    Issue with apostrophes
    Workaround in the docs uses regular expressions and lambda function
    I'm relatively comfortable with regex - not lambda functions

A little research on lambda functions
    An anonymous function - function created without def keyword
    Can define lambdas inside of other code

The workaround in the Python Docs works great outta the box!
The script now successfully prints the company name in Title Case

Goal is to write to new csv all the same data with text fields titlecase:
    Customer, First, Last

While I'm at it—might be worth it to make email all lowercase.
Looks nicer that way.

Got it to work!
Text fields are Title Cased correctly; email is lowercase.

CWT√01

If I can squeeze it in before time's up I'd like to format the phone as well.
I guess I don't have to do ONLY 1 hour - right?
I could go a little over...

Goal with the phone number formatting is:
    Give them all the same separator "-"
    Separate extension out into a its own field
    I guess I'll have to put my regex where my mouth is.

Wow it's been an hour already?
Crazy.

Not quite done with the phone number regex.
Going to do another 10 mins.
If I'm not close by then I'll save it for later.

Got it working!
Extracting the extension was a little tricky at first:
    Could be formatted a number of different ways
    Like x11000 or X 12020 or ext. 1229 or .1235 etc.

Obviously now that I found out how to do that it seems easy.
But that's how it goes I guess.

Last part - write the extension to a new field in the csv.

Ayyy the regex even caught the tricky one where the extension was attached to the number like 111-222-3333444
Ahh the magic of computers...

A little example of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):
    Used the specific repetitions matching functionality to reduce total characters by a few.
    Woooop.
    High and DRY baby!
    Call me Low Tide.

Oh maaaaan...
An hour later I finally got it.
I thought there was something wrong with how I was writing the row.
Or with how I was dealing with the ordered dictionary.
But...
It ended up being a simple matter of variable scope.
...
All it took in the end was a taking a block of code near the end,
and moving it back one tab.

Lesson learned.

But hey, at least the workaround I tried to use actually fixed the order.
It's the little things.
Like looking pretty.
Being neat n tidy.

CWT√02

This Elder Scrolls soundtrack is epic - been my music for the evening:
    https://youtu.be/EL0gz9COxBs

And there you have it, a freshly capitalized and formatted list.

TASK√001

I'll create a list with dummy data to upload as an example.

Created example csv - 001_before.csv
Ran script          - 001_after.csv

Of course...
For no reason at all (that I can think of) the titlecase function isn't fixing the apostrophe problem now...
Will fix and upload everything tomorrow.
----------------º----------------

TASK√ : Create github repo
I wonder if I could bring the code directly in from github to the site?

IDEA√ : Tomorrow - write script to create daily challenge journal entries - with counter / json functionality
