        </div>

            <p>
                The Culture is a fictional interstellar post-scarcity civilization or society created by the Scottish
                writer Iain M. Banks and features in a number of his space opera novels and works of short fiction,
                collectively called the Culture series.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the series, the Culture is composed primarily of sentient
                beings of the pan-human variety, artificially intelligent
                sentient machines, and a small number of other sentient "alien"
                life forms.
                Machine intelligences range from human-equivalent drones to
                hyper-intelligent Minds. The Culture's economy is maintained
                automatically by its non-sentient machines, with high-level
                work entrusted to the Minds' subroutines, which allows its
                humanoid and drone citizens to indulge their passions, romances,
                hobbies, or other activities, without servitude. Many of the
                series' protagonists are humanoids who choose to work for
                the Culture's elite diplomatic or espionage organisations, and
                interact with other civilisations whose citizens hold wildly
                different ideologies, morals, and technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Culture has a grasp of technology which is advanced
                relative to most of the other civilisations which share the
                galaxy. Most of the Culture's citizens do not live on planets
                but in or on artificial habitats, such as huge orbitals, or on
                ships, the largest of which are home to billions of individuals.
                Biologically, the Culture's citizens have been genetically
                enhanced to live for centuries, and have modified mental
                control over their physiology, including the ability to
                introduce a variety of psychoactive drugs into their systems,
                change biological sex, or switch off pain at will. Culture
                technology is able to transform individuals into vastly
                different body forms but, for unclear reasons, the Culture
                standard form remains fairly close to human.
            </p>
            <p>
                A central theme of the series is the ethical struggles which
                face the Culture when interacting with other societies - some
                of which brutalise their own members, pose threats to other
                civilisations, or threaten the Culture itself, the reactions to
                which conflict with the Culture's philosophy of peace and
                individual freedom. The Culture tends to make major decisions
                based on the consensus formed by its Minds and, if appropriate,
                its citizens. In one instance, a direct democratic vote of
                trillions – the entire population – decided The Culture would
                go to war with a rival civilisation. Those who objected to the
                Culture's subsequent militarisation broke off from the
                meta-civilisation, forming their own separate civilisation; a
                hallmark of the Culture is its ambiguity. In contrast to the
                many interstellar societies and empires which share its
                fictional universe, the Culture is difficult to define,
                geographically or sociologically, and "fades out at the edges".
