            <p>
                Since the Culture's biological population commonly live as long as 400 years and have no need to work,
                they face the difficulty
                of giving meaning to their lives when the Minds and other
                intelligent machines can do almost anything better than the
                biological population can.
                Many try—few successfully—to join
                Contact, the Culture's combined diplomatic / military /
                government service, and fewer still are invited to the even
                more elite Special Circumstances (SC), Contact's secret service
                and special operations division. Normal Culture citizens
                vicariously derive meaning from their existence via the works of
                Contact and SC.
            </p>
            <div class="text-highlight">
                Banks described the Culture as "some incredibly rich lady of leisure who does good, charitable
                works...Contact does that on a large scale."
            </div>
            <p>
                The same need to find a purpose for existence
                led the Culture as a whole to embark voluntarily on its only full-scale war, to stop the expansion of
                the theocratic and militaristic Idirans—otherwise the Culture's economic and technological advancement
                would have been a pointless exercise in hedonism.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of the stories feature the tension between the Culture's humane, anarcho-communist ideals and its
                need to intervene in the affairs of less enlightened and often less advanced civilisations. The first
                Culture novel, Consider Phlebas, describes an episode in the Idiran War, which the Culture's Minds
                foresaw would cause billions of deaths on both sides, but which their utilitarian calculations predicted
                would be the best course in the long term. The Idiran War serves as a recurring reference point in most
                of the subsequent novels, influencing the Culture's development for centuries and dividing its
                residents—both humanoids and AI Minds—along the pacifist and interventionist ideals.
            </p>
            <p>
                In subsequent novels, the Culture—particularly SC and, to a lesser degree, Contact—continue to employ
                subterfuge, espionage, and even direct action (collectively called "dirty tricks") in order to protect
                itself and spread the Culture's "good works" and ideals. These dirty tricks include blackmailing
                persons, employing mercenaries, recruiting double agents, attempting to effect regime change, and even
                engaging in false flag operations against the Culture itself (potentially resulting in the death of
                billions). Though each of these individual actions would horrify the average Culture citizen, the
                Culture's Minds tend to justify these actions in terms of lives saved in the long-term, perhaps over the
                course of several hundred years.
            </p>
            <div class="text-highlight">
                The Culture is willing to use not only preemptive, but also retaliatory
                actions in order to deter future hostile actions against itself. Banks commented that in order to
                prevent atrocities, "even the Culture throws away its usual moral rule-book."
            </div>
            <p>
                Andrew M. Butler noted
                that, "Having established the peaceful, utopian, game-playing tendencies of the Culture, ... in later
                volumes the Culture’s dirty tricks are more exposed."
            </p>
            <p>
                The Culture stories have been described as "eerily prescient". Consider Phlebas explicitly presents a
                clash of civilizations, although this phrase was used by Samuel P. Huntington and earlier authors. This
                is highlighted by the novel's description of the Idirans' expansion as a "jihad" and by its epigraphic
                verse from the Koran, "Idolatry is worse than carnage". However, it was as much a "holy war" from the
                Culture's point of view. Throughout the series, Contact and Special Circumstances show themselves
                willing to intervene, sometimes forcefully, in other civilizations to make them more Culture-like.
            </p>
            <p>
                Much of Look to Windward is a commentary on the Idiran-Culture war, from a viewpoint 800 years later,
                mainly reflecting grief over both personal and large-scale losses and guilt over actions taken in the
                war. It combines these with similar reflections on the catastrophic miscarriage of the Culture's attempt
                to dissolve the Chelgrians' oppressive caste system. In neither case, however, does distress over the
                consequences of Culture policy lead its representatives to reject that policy. The book illustrates the
                limitations of power, and also points out that Minds and other AIs are as vulnerable as biological
                persons to grief, guilt and regrets.
