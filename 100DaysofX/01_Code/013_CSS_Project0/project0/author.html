            <p>
                Iain Banks (16 February 1954 – 9 June 2013) was a Scottish author. He wrote mainstream fiction under the
                name Iain Banks and science fiction as Iain M. Banks, including the initial of his adopted middle name
                Menzie.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the publication and success of The Wasp Factory (1984), Banks began to write on a full-time basis.
                His first science fiction book, Consider Phlebas, was released in 1987, marking the start of the Culture
                series. His books have been adapted for theatre, radio and television. In 2008, The Times named Banks in
                their list of "The 50 greatest British writers since 1945". In April 2013, Banks announced that he had
                inoperable cancer and was unlikely to live beyond a year. He died on June 9, 2013.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h2 id="early-life">Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                Banks was born in Dunfermline, Fife, to a mother who was a professional ice skater and a father who was
                an officer in the Admiralty. An only child, Banks lived in North Queensferry until the age of nine, near
                the naval dockyards in Rosyth where his father was based. Banks's family then moved to Gourock due to
                the requirements of his father's work. When someone introduced him to science fiction by giving him
                Kemlo and the Zones of Silence, he continued reading the Kemlo series which made him want to write
                science fiction himself. After attending Gourock and Greenock High Schools, Banks studied English,
                philosophy and psychology at the University of Stirling (1972–1975).
            </p>
            <p>
                After graduation Banks chose a succession of jobs that left him free to write in the evenings. These
                posts supported his writing throughout his twenties and allowed him to take long breaks between
                contracts, during which time he travelled through Europe and North America. He was an expediter analyser
                for IBM, a technician for the British Steel Corporation and a costing clerk for a Chancery Lane, London,
                law firm during this period of his life.

            <h2>Writing Career</h2>
            <p>
                Banks decided to become a writer at the age of 11. He completed his first novel The Hungarian Lift-Jet
                at 16 and his second novel TTR (aka The Tashkent Rambler) during his first year at Stirling University
                in 1972. Though he considered himself primarily a science fiction author, his lack of success at being
                published as such led him to pursue mainstream fiction, resulting in his first published novel The Wasp
                Factory, which was published in 1984 when he was thirty. After the publication and success of The Wasp
                Factory, Banks began to write full-time. His editor at Macmillan, James Hale, advised him to write one
                book a year and Banks agreed to this schedule.
            </p>
            <p>
                His second novel Walking on Glass was published in 1985. The Bridge followed in 1986, and Espedair
                Street, published in 1987, was later broadcast as a series on BBC Radio 4. His first published science
                fiction book Consider Phlebas was released in 1987 and was the first of several novels of the acclaimed
                Culture series. Banks cited Robert A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Brian Aldiss, M. John
                Harrison and Dan Simmons as literary influences. The Crow Road, published in 1992, was adapted as a BBC
                television series. Banks continued to write both science fiction and mainstream novels, with his final
                novel The Quarry published in June 2013, the month of his death.
            </p>
            <p>
                Banks published work under two names. His parents had intended to name him "Iain Menzies Banks", but his
                father made a mistake when registering the birth and "Iain Banks" became the officially registered name.
                Despite this error, Banks used the middle name and submitted The Wasp Factory for publication as "Iain
                M. Banks". Banks's editor inquired about the possibility of omitting the 'M' as it appeared "too fussy"
                and the potential existed for confusion with Rosie M. Banks, a romantic novelist in the Jeeves novels by
                P.G. Wodehouse; Banks agreed to the omission. After three mainstream novels, Banks's publishers agreed
                to publish his first science fiction (SF) novel Consider Phlebas. To create a distinction between the
                mainstream and SF novels, Banks suggested the return of the 'M' to his name, and it was used in all of
                his science fiction works.
            </p>
            <p>
                By his death in June 2013 Banks had published 26 novels. His twenty-seventh novel The Quarry was
                published posthumously. His final work, a collection of poetry, was released in February 2015. In an
                interview January 2013, he also mentioned he had the plot idea for another novel in the Culture series,
                which would most likely be his next book and planned for publication in 2014.

            <h2>Bibliography</h2>
            <p>
                Banks wrote thirteen science-fiction novels, nine of which were part of the Culture series; and a short
                story collection called The State of the Art (1991) includes some stories set in the same universe.
                These works focus upon characters that are usually on the margins of the Culture, a post-scarcity
                anarchist utopia; in the same universe are other civilizations, with which the Culture sometimes enters
                into conflict, and sentient artificial intelligences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Banks' non-science-fiction work comprises fourteen novels and one non-fiction book. Many of his novels
                contain elements of autobiography, and feature various locations in his native Scotland. Raw Spirit
                (subtitled In Search of the Perfect Dram) is a travel book of Banks' visits to the distilleries of
                Scotland in search of the finest whisky, including his musings on other subjects such as cars and
                politics.
