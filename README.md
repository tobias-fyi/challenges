## 2019

I plan to complete three #100DaysofX challenges in 2019.  

1. 100DaysofCode
2. 100DaysofStory
3. 100Daysof...

And I might just keep doing three per year after that...

### 01 - Code

\#100DaysofCode

- Day 001: Mon, Mar 04, 2019
- Day 100: Wed, Jun 11, 2019

    GOALâˆš01.01 : Spend at least one hour coding every day for one hundred days  
    GOAL-01.02 : Complete HarvardX's CS50W course on edX / receive certificate  
    GOAL-01.03 : Attend at least 3 meetups (probably in / around Denver)  

I completed the primary goal of coding for at least one hour every day for 100 days. I did not complete the other two. However, those goals were more of stretch goals.
