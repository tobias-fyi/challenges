            "body": "<p>There are bones in the road.</p>\n\n<p>This road has been trod before. Many times before; by many different people. Many different types of people.</p>\n\n<p>Some, may not be people at all\u2014maybe not <em>human</em> at all.</p>\n\n<p>\"Still...\" Torlan thought aloud to himself and anyone else who may be listening, \"Bones are a good sign. Something is alive\u2014or was alive.\"</p>\n\n<p>Torlan had been on the dusty, dry road for as long as he could remember. How far back could he remember?</p>\n\n<p>His mind didn't seem to have the capacity for hindsight.</p>\n\n<p>\"I haven't been here my entire life,\" He thought, not for the first time. His mouth automatically formed the words, making the sound which those thoughts took in the physical realm.</p>\n\n<p>He sipped liquid from a tube that reached over his left shoulder.</p>\n\n<p>Torlan found some amount of a strange comfort in the fact that he knew he would not have survived out here long enough to grow to full strength. He also knew if he tried to remember what actually came before the road, he would find nothing but disappointment\u2014worse than dissapointment, in fact. A void stretched out behind him. He could not turn around or risk being lost in it.</p>\n\n<p>---- \u222b ----</p>\n\n<p><em>There are bones in the road.</em></p>\n\n<p>There were beings on this road before me.</p>\n\n<p>Any semblance of a consistent thread of thought blew away with a new breeze that swept over the road, tossing grains of sand at him.</p>\n\n<p>The sip of water Torlan had consumed\u2014what was it, minutes...hours ago?</p>\n\n<p>\"A minute, if that.\"</p>\n\n<p>He only had to think hard enough to understand basic facts about his situation.</p>\n\n<p>The water felt as if it were dripping down his throat; his stomache. Therefore, he knew that it must have not been more than a minute since he took that drink.</p>\n\n<p><em>Shit</em>...Torlan thought, this time without his mouth opening. If he had taken in enough water to feel it so distinctly, he could reason two possible scenarios:</p>\n\n<p><em>One: I accidentally took in too much water.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Two: I am more dehydrated than I thought.</em></p>\n\n<p>He walked on the road. He traveled over bones. <em>This road has a history.</em></p>\n\n<p>---- \u222b ----</p>\n\n<p>Torlan wandered on down the road. He was being led to something, he knew. How he knew, he worried not. A carefree traveler <em>does</em> still have a history, whether or not he carries it with him.</p>\n\n<p>Everything has a history, even if it is never considered. Each one of the bones has its own history. Torlan wondered not about the them\u2014why or how they got there.</p>\n\n<p>Torlan noticed that he actually was getting somewhere. Small dunes paralleled the road to his left, stretching into the distance until being lost in the haze near the horizon. </p>\n\n<p>Each mound of the offwhite sand was indistinguishable from the next, particularly when no one is paying them much attention. Torlan felt a new thought bump up to against the edge of his consciousness, his mouth half-forming the half-forgotten question.</p>\n\n<p>His attention was on the bones, however, forcing all other thoughts out into the haze of his subconscious. Some of the bones on which he walked were easily as long as he was tall.</p>\n\n<p>There are bones in the road. They hadn't always been this size...</p>\n\n<p><em>...had they?</em></p>\n\n<p>---- \u222b ----</p>\n\n<p>He watched one bone in particular, as thick around as his waist, from when it first appeared out of the dusty haze until he he stepped over it. It was curved slightly upward, causing a section of one end to jut out of the loose almost-white sand next to the road.</p>\n\n<p>Torlan noticed that he'd stopped walking. He was standing on the packed sand directly on top of where he imagined the bone would intersect the road.</p>\n\n<p>His ears still expected to hear the sound of his footsteps; his consistent breath, in and out; the occasional creak of something in his pack; a scrape as two external surfaces of his exosuit rubbed against one another. Now, he could hear the sand, seemingly able to pick out the faint clicking of individual grains as they shifted with the wind.</p>\n\n<p>The sudden change in sonic scenery made his scalp tingle, starting from directly behind each of his ears and spreading to his forehead. A spattering of knock-knock sounds came from the direction of the the bit of bone protruding from the sand's surface as the larger sand particles struck it.</p>\n\n<p>\"How far does it go?\" Torlan wondered out loud, the sound of his voice turning the scalp-tingle into a shiver that ran down his spine. </p>\n\n<p>His eyes refocused on the dunes a few hundred meters beyond the point of the immense bone. Their shape looked oddly like the spine of some enormous creature laying buried under a thin layer of the light-colored sand.</p>\n\n<p>The shiver lingered for a few seconds, the hairs on the back of his neck and arms would've raised had they not been covered by the protective envelope of his suit. That thought gave him some comfort.</p>\n\n<p>As Torlan dropped his gaze to the road under his feet and the bones buried below, he let out the lung-full of air he hadn't noticed he'd been holding.</p>\n\n<p><em>Held since...</em></p>\n\n<p><em>...since...?</em></p>\n\n<p><em>...since...I stopped?</em></p>\n\n<p>The breeze was picking up, he noticed, his eyes tracing the line in the sand in front of him until it melded with the undefined horizon.</p>\n\n<p>---- \u222b ----</p>\n\n<p>He continued along the road. There are bones in the road.</p>\n\n<p>Larger and larger pieces of bone\u2014more frequent, too.</p>\n\n<p>Torlan began to pick out a pattern. They were more frequent and more regular than before. The dual primary stars danced their way toward the dunes; the shadows cast by the now-towering dual lines of bones stretched across the surface of the road.</p>\n\n<p>Bones on either side of him were standing taller than the tip of his visor, slowly enclosing him in.</p>\n\n<p>His eyes fixed on a large patch of sunlight hitting the road in front of him. Once again he watched it approach until he was looking at his boots standing in a settling cloud of dust.</p>\n\n<p>He looked up slowly. He found himself looking through a hole in the wall; a wall of bone. A number of consecutive bones\u2014ribs\u2014had been broken off at about chest-level, creating a sort of window. The broken pieces laying half-covered by sand of a similar color.</p>\n\n<p>\"Convenient.\"</p>\n\n<p>He leaning his elbows against the sill of the window to watch the suns set over the dunes.</p>\n\n<p>The last rays disappeared behind the darkening mounds of sand. Now that he spent some time looking at the dunes, they also seemed too regular; too indistinguishable from one another.</p>\n\n<p>He heard something then\u2014a steady, drawn out rumbling almost too low for his ears to pick up. It grew in strength.</p>\n\n<p>He could feel it. His chest cavity reverberated with the vibrations.</p>\n\n<p>The sound died down, following the fading light into nothingness.</p>\n\n<p><em>It gets dark here</em> really <em>fast...</em></p>\n\n<p>He began to push off from the window sill to walk on, away from the strangeness of that moment. He had been looking down the tunnel as the last of the light and sound faded, and when he gazed through the window one last time...</p>\n\n<p><em>...something isn't right.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>I'd swear there were dunes just over there before...</em></p>\n\n<p>\"...the suns set...\"</p>\n\n<p>His voice trailed off....</p>\n\n<p>A slightly confused expression faded from his dark features.</p>\n\n<p>Torlan closed his mouth, turned to face the waiting road, drew in a deep breath through the filters in his nostrils, and walked.</p>\n\n<p>---- \u222b ----</p>",

In fact, out of those that survived collision, they are the only ones that remain, living out their unknown lives on an unknown planet.</p>\n<p>All of the humans died off long ago. Even with all their advanced technology\u2014the machrobians, who are now the\u2014could never live forever. As much as they have tried and tried, their soft, organic bodies were not made to stand the test of time.</p>\n<p>The population of them that used their technology to artificially extend their lives, whether physically or mentally, could have easily filled up an entire world. Some say that at least a semblance of their former humanity remained after the transition. But not a single one of them would ever be considered the same entity, both legally and socially, as they were before the process. </p>\n<p>No, humans are transitory beings. They exist for a short while, they grow, they wither, then they are gone.</p>\n<p>There is something magical about that\u2014at least the machrobians thought so. Machrobians can potentially live forever, if they had a ready supply of materials with which they could repair themselves. This fact had always been a sensitive subject between the two species.</p>\n<p>Many machrobians felt a limited existence was something sacred, and legally restricted their own access to new parts. The so-called \"pure mechanistic\" machros even went so far as to restrict access to <em>any and all</em> new parts. They would not let themselves be repaired; not even for minor maintenance issues. Not even humans can say that. For the most part, their bodies do it automatically, whether they want it to or not.</p>\n<p>The machrobians on Noema, as their human counterparts had called the world that would end up being their last home, were not pure mechanists. They continued to persist for at least a thousand years beyond the lifespan of the last living human. They salvaged parts and repurposed components they found spread around the entirety of the little world\u2014the reactor of the ENo-class cruise ship eventually exploded, spewing its guts far and wide. Some bits of the ship, driven by the blast, achieved escape velocity and ended up in orbit. </p>\n<p>The surviving machrobians used those guts to repair their own guts and to build their own little civilization.</p>\n<p>The reactor's explosion washed everything on the planet in a wave of electromagnetic energy. To humans outside the blast radius itself, the frequency and strength did relatively little damage. What damage it did cause could mostly be healed by time.</p>\n<p>The machrobians were not so lucky. The dose of energy they received was just strong enough and at just the right frequency such that the processing unit of every single one of them was altered ever so slightly. It was a subtle change\u2014neither the humans nor the machros even noticed. But the damage was done, and could not be healed.</p>\n<p>While the machrobians' kept their unique intelligences, they could not provide the help that the humans requested in order to build a new ship from the wreckage. The humans thought the machros were purposefully keeping this from them, and relations between the two groups eventually soured.</p>\n<p>The machrobians did not understand why the humans became increasingly hostile. An effect of their changed processing units, maybe. Seeing the machros repairing themselves using salvaged parts, the humans convinced themselves that the machros were lying. The vast majority of the humans believed the machros were building their own ship in secret and were planning to leave their organic counterparts on Noema. As humans tend to do in desparate situations such as this, they attacked.</p>\n<p>Their soft, organic bodies were not built to stand the test of gravity when tested from the edge of a miles-deep chasm.</p>\n<p>An even smaller group of them survived that encounter, and the rest of their days were lived out in relative peace and comfort...in a damaged-backwater-world sort of way.</p>\n<p>Alone on the unknown planet, the machrobians continued their cycle of scavenging, repairing, and occasionally even building something new.</p>\n<hr />",

            "body": "<p>\"You are quite a daring individual,\" The Opalian Cometus for Proximates, Arsena, said in a too-casual tone. She couldn't completely hide the surprise in her voice\u2014nor the hidden smile behind the words. She did not turn her head to look at the man standing next to her.</p>\n<p>The two humanoids stood facing a breathtaking view of Opalia, the fourth planet from the star Nymia, around which the CitySphere October now orbited. </p>\n<p>\"I can forget that you said those particular words, in that particular order, just then.\" The Cometery sipped her drink gingerly, swallowed, and turned to face Misti\u00e9. Her voice level; controlled.</p>\n<p>\"Or, I could try to convince myself that it was a rhetorical remark.\" </p>\n<p>Olmon Misti\u00e9 considered her, seeming to mull this over. Her eyes now contained ripples of a deep, subtle maroon around the edges, surrounding and mixing in with the shifting opalescent shades in the center of each. He had never seen anything like them\u2014a rare occasion for someone like him.</p>\n<p>\"I have never met a native Opalian before. I meant no offense\u2014quite the opposite, in fact.\"</p>\n<p>\"You understand, C.O. Olman, that your arrival has made my life of late rather...difficult. My people, nor those of the other Nymiatic do not take kindly to having this\u2014\", She turned her head in an arc, looking and gesturing with those inconceivable eyes at the Sphere around them, \"\u2014within the Opalian Proximate.\"</p>\n<p>Over the course of his galactic travels, he'd socialized enough with aniridic species to be relatively comfortable not knowing exactly where they were looking. This situation was no exception. He wasn't unduly bothered that he couldn't tell if she was looking into his eyes. If anything, it added to her mystique.</p>\n<p>He made a show of carefully choosing his words. And, in a sense, he was.</p>\n<p>Olmon knew she was the patient type. Speaking too quickly would likely derail the situation. The statement he made earlier had very nearly done just that.</p>\n<p>\"Nine standard centuries is a long time, though even eternity is not long enough to forget Rozein.\" He hoped he didn't come off as too cheesy or emotional.</p>\n<p>He had thus far held off on releasing a dose of Set, a drug that reduces emotional impulse, into his bloodstream. Olmon had made a bold move, and wanted to ride this moment a little while longer. Being held captive by her nebulous gaze was an immensely pleasurable experience. He fervently hoped this encounter would lead to even more pleasure, and if he gave himself a dose of Set the enchantment would undoubtedly end. It was his last resort; his internal \"abort\" button.</p>\n<p>She was right\u2014he <em>was</em> a daring individual.</p>\n<p>---- \u222b ----</p>\n<p>At the center of each Sphere is a miniscule singularity\u2014a black hole\u2014that provided a theoretically infinite supply of gravity and power to the Sphere. The concept was popular at first. Spheres and the various attractions they carried with them garnered large crowds of locals from every society they visited.</p>\n<p>Nine centuries prior, still-unknown circumstances caused the failure of one of the first-generation Spheres. Somehow, the myriad failsafes put in place did not prevent the Continent-class Sphere from crashing into a planet in the Rozein System. A larger singularity, yet still small on a galactic scale, is the only indication that the system ever existed at all.</p>\n<p>Friendly relations between CitySpheres and planetary societies, such as those in the Opalia Proximate, had been virtually nonexistent ever since the Rozein Cataclysm\u2014for good reason. Those that decided to continue living in the Spheres were forced out every inhabited system. Also for good reason.</p>\n<p>---- \u222b ----</p>\n<p>His City-class Sphere October had appeared, unannounced, out of the depths of interstellar space. Given the emotional and political climate surrounding Spheres ever since the Rozein Cataclysm, he considered himself lucky that he had chanced upon the Nymian System and not one of more hostile systems. </p>\n<p>He and the community living aboard October had grown accustomed to being turned away light-months out from a system, sometimes by force. However, the \"defenders' had to be very careful with the amount of force they applied to drive the Sphere out.</p>\n<p>Too much force could result in another Rozein.</p>\n<p>\"We are\u2014every one of us\u2014grateful to you and your people for not running us off at first sight,\" Olmon said, slightly raising his right arm, palm up, in the customary Opalian gesture of gratitude. \"You have allowed us to peacefully enter your proximate space\u2014and around such a resplendent homeworld\u2014a kindness most systems would not consider.\"</p>\n<p>\"You've already done us a favor which we could never hope to repay,\" Misti\u00e9 said. He smiled broadly as he turned to once again swim in those pools of colorful quicksilver. \"If there is anything any one of us can do\u2014and I mean <em>any</em> one\u2014to begin to repay that debt, please do not hesitate to ask.\"</p>\n<p>He decided to continue walking the line. Bowing, he said, \"I am at your service.\"</p>\n<p>---- \u222b ----</p>\n<p>It had been a long time since he'd spent time interacting with any species outside of those that shared his CitySphere. His lack of practice showed at first\u2014he'd laugh at the wrong time or miss the opportunity to express concern. As the evening wore on, however, he rediscovered the silver tongue that he once took so much pride in.</p>\n<p>But she was the first of her kind that he'd ever met. There were bound to be cultural norms that he wouldn't understand without years of intimate interaction. Over the course of their conversation, he'd been doing his best at noting her every move and choice of words, mentally grouping them with any corellary emotion she decided to express.</p>\n<p>\"There is something...\" Arsena said, he voice trailing off. There was something underneath. Olmon could not quite place it, though he knew what he <em>hoped</em> the subliminal message to be.</p>\n<p>Confirmation bias can be tricky sometimes.</p>\n<p>\"Will you share your technology with us? We have been working on system for controlling a small singularity, as you do to keep your CitySphere running. But we have not been successful as of yet.\"</p>\n<p>Forcing his eyes to look away from Arsena's, Olmon Misti\u00e9 drew in a breath and turned back to the view of Opalia. He did not want her to see the disappointment that had briefly crossed his face. </p>\n<p>The planet was nearly as enchanting, though he was not the type to have sexual feelings for inanimate objects. A similar spectrum of colors\u2014shades of magenta and cyan, mostly\u2014tinged the tips of the thunderheads. The colors grew more vibrant as his eyes swept toward the curved horizon which hid the system's star.</p>\n<p>He could not risk this world. Even to guarantee continued relations with a being as exquisite as Arsena, it was not worth it.</p>\n<p>The disappointment that had made his stomach heavy was replaced by a cold determination as the Set entered his bloodstream.</p>\n<p>---- \u222b ----</p>",

As they entered the mouth of the hideout, the flakes turned into falling embers for a few brief moments, only to be extinguished as they hit the floor.</p>\n\n<p>The spark of hope that had kept her spirits up through the decades spent on Elaneva had also been extinguished.</p>\n\n<p>Out of the group of her people she had brought to the ill-fated world, Ira was the only one left. Of the entire population of the majestic underground metropolis of Daras, the Vana she saw in front of her were likely the only ones left.</p>\n\n<p>Ira knew this phase was over; there was nothing more to be done.</p>\n\n<p>If she didn't let go, millions more would die\u2014because of <em>her</em>.</p>\n\n<p>She would've happily died to save the millions that perished in Daras.</p>\n\n<p>---- \u222b ----</p>\n\n<p>The Domari were ruthless, particularly when dealing with a valuable assets like Elaneva and the Alagevana people who inhabited it. This world and the handful of others like it were the lifeblood of Domari power and wealth.</p>\n\n<p><em>They'll do whatever it takes to keep that lifeblood flowing...</em></p>\n\n<p>The rising intensity of the fusion reactors was now putting butterflies in her stomach. Those reactors were the reason she was able to make the light-years-long crossing of the Well.</p>\n\n<p>There was always a certain electric excitement when she heard their warm-up routine. To have all of that power behind her\u2014it was an intoxicating experience, particularly during the first few hours of flight when she could still use the nearby planets and stars as reference points.</p>\n\n<p>The excitement bubbled, pushing against the internal walls she had thrown up to protect against the brain-deadening grief of the last few days.</p>\n\n<p>She guessed that Domari were no strangers to extermination. In their grand scheme, losing a few cities of tens of millions each was not much of an issue, if it meant they retained their complete and utter dominance.</p>\n\n<p>The ship entered the final stages of its preamble, the frequency of the reactors now too high for even the Vana to hear with their ears. A low-frequency resonance began, as Ira knew it would, oscillating slowly back and forth between the reactors. Her body suddered involuntarily as the vibrations reached her through air and rock, just as the shockwaves from the extermination mines had done a few days before.</p>\n\n<p>Ira now understood something of the menace that Domari posed to every decent civilization in the galaxy. By themselves, her people would not make a dent in their defenses, and would likely be wiped out with one single retaliative strike.</p>\n\n<p>That was why she had been sent with only a small group of Outside Agents. If the powers that be in Syn Domari somehow learned of their intentions, every citizen in the Proximate would be a target.</p>\n\n<p>They had some terribly big guns. Worse yet, they did not hesitate to use them.</p>\n\n<p>If allowed to continue, unchecked, on their current trajectory...</p>\n\n<p><em>How long until they are the most powerful force in the galaxy?</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Then what happens?</em></p>\n\n<p>---- \u222b ----</p>",

His primary focus was trained on the narrow ridgeline and the quickly disintegrating footsteps of his partner, who he kept between three and five meters in front of him.</p>\n<p>Thus, he had his visor tilted down, which had the added benefit of keeping the sun out of his eyes\u2014though the active nanomatter in the visor itself mirrored up whenever he looked up. He had not needed to raise his visor in some time, as a real-time, high-res representation of the landscape around and above him was displayed on the inside of his visor. That nanomatter was some seriously badass tech.</p>\n<p>The sensor arrays on the exterior of his helmet gathered far more data than he could ever ingest in real-time. He cycled through the different modes of gathering data, examining the distant ruins as if he were a hundred meters away seeing through the eyes of a shard-eyed Voeler. Then: a Galam soldier, vision tinged with ultraviolet reflections.</p>\n<p>The two armoured figures walked, bringing the crumbling towers closer, step by step. Readouts of distances, temperatures, topographies\u2014you name it.</p>\n<p>\"With all of the tech they managed to shove into these things, you'd think they would've included at least a basic flight system,\" his partner had said over the radio soon after setting out on foot across the rolling wasteland. \"But man do they have a slim profile.\"</p>\n<p>\"Very light. Great action.\" He hopped around, throwing his limbs out this way and that\u2014as if that was what happened in a real fight. He skipped toward his unsuspecting partner, who had turned away from him. The suit appended his actions, allowing him to cover the distance between them in what seemed like the blink of an eye.</p>\n<p>His partner was wearing an identical suit, however, and didn't even have to look to easily dodged the half-assed attack. They sparred briefly to get a feel for the suits before embarking on the real test\u2014their secret sauce.</p>\n<p>---- \u222b ----</p>",

However, they had grown somewhat accustomed to being confronted with situations such as this\u2014as accustomed as anyone <em>could</em> grow to something like this. It was how they had turned such a significant profit over the last few years since retiring from Outside, where they had seen far more than their share of active battles.</p>\n<p>The landscape they'd been trekking across, which was borderline desertous, ended abruptly at the bottom of the hill. They were now looking out over an expanse of swampy marshland between their vantage point\u2014if that's what it could be called\u2014and the mountains in the not-so-distance.</p>\n<p>That was one of the stranger things about life on an orbital: when the world curves up and over your head instead of down below your feet\u2014and out of sight\u2014the concept of a vantage point can sometimes get confused. With a powerful enough lens, one could theoretically have line-of-sight to the rest of the world. Sometimes it felt like you're at the very bottom of the world, with everyone looking down on you; sometimes like you're at the top, able to look down on everyone else.</p>\n<p>Either of those sensations could get particularly vivid on a ring as small as KG, though you did get used to it after a while.</p>\n<p>---- \u222b ----</p>\n<p>\"Looks like we'll get to see first-hand how waterproof these bad boys are,\" he said after initiating their secure coms channel by touching the other man's suit with his own. This was a standard feature on just about every half-decent exosuit on the market.</p>\n<p>They would maintain radio silence from now until they had a <em>very</em> good reason to break it. With an opponent as capable as the one they faced, they could not take any chances. Even tightbeam light communication over short distances could potentially be traced and intercepted.</p>\n<p>Over the last few hours of their walk, storm clouds began to brew over the ruins. It was obviously not a natural phenomena. The billowing clouds billowed up but stayed in place, directly on top of the ruins, shrouding them in darkness, rain, and the occasional lightning bolt for good measure.</p>\n<p>It felt like the storm was showing off for any onlookers who happened to be looking on; for them.</p>\n<p>---- \u222b ----</p>",
