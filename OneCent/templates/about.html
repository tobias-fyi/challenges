        <h2>Hi!
          <br>My name is <i>Tobias.</i></h2>
        <p>---- ∫ ----</p>
        <p>For those who don't know exactly what the #100DaysofX challenge is, it simply means that I'm dedicating
          myself to doing an activity or practicing a skill for at least 1 hour every day for 100 days in a
          row.</p>
        <p>It all started when in March of 2019. I'd started learning how to develop software a few months
          before that and wanted to make learning and writing code a daily habit. I ran across the #100DaysofCode
          challenge and decided it would be a great way to make that happen. I finished th coding challenge in the
          middle of June, and started my writing one the next day. All 100 of the daily coding journals from
          #100DaysofCode can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/tobias-fyi/challenges/">GitHub</a> (along with
          the stories and the code for this site).</p>
        <p>It was such so effective for coding that I decided to do the same thing with other skills that I've wanted to
          develop.</p>
        <p>---- ∫ ----</p>
        <p>I've been a sci-fi enthusiast and on-and-off writer since I was a little tyke. I've always enjoyed writing,
          but had
          never dedicated myself to developing the skill in any meaningful way...until now.</p>
        <p>One reason I never spent any meaninful amount of time writing fiction is because I only ever did it when I
          had tons of inspiration. The whole point of the challenge is to make the promise to myself that I will write
          for at least an hour
          every single day, whether I feel like it, am inspired, have time, or not. No excuses...</p>
        <p>Some of the stories are good; some are ok; some may be terrible or undeveloped or have any number of
          qualities that don't make me happy.</p>
        <p>And that's ok—I'm going to write anyways.</p>
        <p>
          <b><i>It's all a practice.</i></b>
        </p>
        <p>---- ∫ ----</p>
        <p>I hope you enjoy at least some of my stories. If you do, I'd love to hear about it! (Or if you have some
          <i>constructive</i> criticism).
